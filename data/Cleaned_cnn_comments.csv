"The way we have been dealing with Russia and China is NOT the best way. In trying to safeguard human rights abroad we create an even bigger problem. It's understood that Russia and China have some issues with human rights, but we need to deal with them in a way to not create even worse human rights violations. For example, we have been antagonizing Putin for things such as the poisoning of one of his oppositors. Putin gets pissed off and decides to break away from the West and as a consequence we have this war which busts even more human rights such as: the right to life, the right to basic living conditions, no torture or rape, the right to food etc, etc. What started as one outrageous human right violation degenerated into several horrible human rights violations. So whenever we deal with countries who are violating human rights we must be smart. How can we improve their human rights performance without plummeting into a worse situation? That's where diplomacy enters. George' wife, Huma Abedin is a Human rights lawyer. Fine. That's her job. But she is NOT the kind of person to advise the US or British governments, because her scope is only the scope of her clients. ",2,7200.0

Angrily said, your small house (Taiwan) has no resources, I let you do business in my big house (Mainland China), you can survive, how can you repay your kindness and revenge and return the small house to me? The owner of the house said that I was doing business in a big house (Mainland China), and I made a lot of money from my friend (United States), and today you will eat and get fat. It was you who used to talk to your friend (USSR) Together they occupied the big house (Mainland China) where I lived, and drove me to live in a small house (Taiwan). You are the one who will avenge the revenge, and you should return the big house (Mainland China) to me. At this time, the hooligans were very angry. Said brat, I'm going to kill you, and then the owner of the small house said I'm not a brat, I'm your senior (Republic of China), your junior (People's Republic of China), now a hooligan (The CCP) said that if you want to continue living, don‚Äôt make friends with me (living alone), then the owner of the small house said that I just like to make friends, and I will continue to make more friends in the future (Australia, France, Japan, the United Kingdom) ....) , how?

This is a tragedy and a further tragedy that a father would take his 18 yo son on such a dangerous trip with him.

"Sorry to hear that they all may be gone. 
What I Just don't understand is how this could have happened. You'd think the Submersible would have had as sofisticated communication devices as the Submersible itself. For example, Like a GPS system that would keep it's location monitored in 'Real Time' for one. Also if that wasn't possible, then why wasn't there some sort of 'Life Line'. I realize that it was probably 2 miles down. But that would make sense to me to have something in place for this very reason. ",1,216.0
"Of course it's from the sub... People have been saying since day one that it couldn't take the pressure and imploded... Is heartbreaking as it is, it doesn't seem like anyone suffered and if they weren't coming home, that's the second best outcome.

The sudden intake of seawater, which is a non-compressible liquid at 375 atmospheres, would compress any living tissue, which is a 1 atmosphere in the submersible Titan is instantly destroyed. There would be no body to recover from the wreck.",55,216.0
The wouldn't have mentioned a debris field unless they were fairly certain of what it was.,51,216.0
RIP! They have passed away! I just pray that their deaths went quickly! It is not worth it to take this type of risks! The money they paid for this trip could have been used to bless people that are struggling financiallyI I pray that they were all saved! My condolences to their family and loved ones! ,5,216.0
It is hard to understand why the sub did not have some kind of locating equipment. Even an automatic noise maker.,35,216.0
"I understand wanting to find the Titanic in the beginning for the purposes of mapping its location on the ocean floor and some scientific questions.  What I don‚Äôt understand is tourists wanting to go to the depths of the ocean to see a ship that carried thousands of souls to their graves.  I‚Äôm not in the business of telling people what to do, but I don‚Äôt understand risking oneself to see where others perished on the ocean floor.  These types of expeditions were bound to run into issues and now people are risking their lives trying to find these tourists.  I truly hope that they are found, but the odds are not in our favor.",28,216.0

At first I though well the Titanic debris field is there that's probably what they are seeing. And then it's reported that the debris field is not of Titanic and that it is new. My heart just stopped. They lost contact little over an hour and a half into the descent to Titanic. They never made it. Now Titanic is a resting place for 5 more.,21,216.0
I was imagining what conversations were going on as time was running out.  Would they have agreed to accept their fate and attempt to cause the submersible to implode to put their suffering to an immediate end vs gasping to death in panic.  I'd have signed up for the former if I was aboard.,7,216.0
Its crazy how they found this little submersible but cant find a big air plane wow ,1,216.0
"I was watching a video 2 weeks ago about the Titanic sinking and when this saga started, I thought the same thing couple happened to the submersible, it filled with water and imploded. A vehicle that low under the ocean will just imploded on itself if it fills with water too quickly.",2,216.0

"I thought they didn't have any carbon dioxide scrubbers. So CO2 would build up to toxic levels prior to running out of O2 (or whatever mix they were using.  The thing is, even if they had a lengthy survival period, the air was getting more and more toxic the whole time, and I don't imagine there were any food/drink or toilet facilities in this little crumpled tin can in the sea. Instead dark, ever colder, packed like sardines,  marinating in your own and everyone else's juices and excretiona. Just waiting to die in terror and (presumably) guilt if you're the Ocean Gate CEO or the dad who Darwin awarded himself and his teenager. A quick implosion is far more merciful than that nightmare. Based on their ""testing and safety"" processes this was inevitable. I agree their approach was innovative, but deadly. Dance on  the knife edge, eventually you'll get cut.

"i'm guessing they really were at first banging on the sides for days ... they knew today was the last of the oxygen and i think they all made a decision that they were not going to suffer without oxygen.  So they opened up the emergency latch and the whole thing burst immediately because of the pressure down there.  I do not believe anyone suffered.  I think it probably happened immediately once they opened the gate.  The debris today floating along the ocean just above where the sub was situated / stuck, are the result of the sub breaking into a million pieces.  - this is my conclusion and thoughts on what might have happened.  - all of the crew stuck there knew the fate and wanted an instant death rather than a suffering death, so they made this decision together.  You have to remember, they had ZERO communication with the outside world, so all of these search and rescue attempts, they had zero clue was going on along with all the media attention.  They had nothing to go on other than being under since Sunday and knowing today was the last of the oxygen.  I think it's no surprise that TODAY is the day they suddenly find a million pieces of the sub floating on the ocean.  - take a moment to ask yourself, what would you do.  - today the people in that sub were met with all the souls on-board the titanic to greet them and welcome them home.",1,216.0

Even a technician could rig it up to withstand the pressures at depth. That is the most basic safety device found on any weekend charter boat.

"I just watched a short interview with an expert in the field from Cambridge, MA. He says the only realistic recovery possible would be to sink another submersible down to attach a line to the vessel. This line would essentially pull up the trapped sub. The line/cable is attached to a shock absorber on a ship on the surface to ensure it doesn't snap. The cable has a maximum length of 20,000 feet, which is more than sufficient in length. This method has been used to recover wrecks of small planes. Time was not as critical during previous missions, as the crew was already deseased. However, firstly the sunken vessel needs to be located. Even if it is located, logistically, getting the correct equipment on scene is unlikely within the given time frame due to complexity of such a rescue mission. This mission would also put the rescue team in grave danger of suffering the same fate.",18,240.0

It does show us how far technology has come and how much more it has to go. It also show‚Äôs how much coordination and logistics is involved and that 96 hours window is too little. It also show‚Äôs how much security and redundancy is important. And explorer is not a tourist.,79,240.0
"The ‚Äòdetail‚Äô I‚Äôve not seen discussed is that they lost contact 1h 45 into the mission, but it is about 2h 30 to the bottom (apparently 8h mission, 2.5 down, 2.5 up, 3 hours there). Depending on the true meaning of ‚Äòlost contact‚Äô, they either know contact was lost at 1h 45, or 1h 45 was the last communication received of regular 15 min check-ins. Either way, that puts them 30 to 45 mins from the bottom, i.e. contact was lost before they got to the bottom and so before a possible entanglement in the wreck. And that means something else happened between 1h 45 and 2h will still in descent. Is that ‚Äòas simple‚Äô as an electrical failure and so loss of communication and control, or something more catastrophic? It would be better if they knew they had made it to the wreck as so approx where they are, rather than knowing ‚Äòsomething went wrong‚Äô 3/4 or the way down. I fear a sad ending. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll find them. They‚Äôll likely recover the vessel. But the chance of doing this in time and getting them all home alive seems very slim ",43,240.0

"The disappearance of the Titan submersible could be the plot for a horror movie: The bodies of almost 1200 of the Titanic's passengers were never recovered, mostly trapped inside the wreckage.  111 years after it sank, those 1200 bodies awaken as zombies who surround and hold onto the Titan submersible, preventing it from surfacing.  The physical bodies of the 1200 unrecovered passengers already disintegrated or were consumed by wildlife within 10 to 20 years after the ship sank.  But the spirits of those 1200 lost souls continue to haunt the wreckage 111 years later.  So maybe one of those zombie spirits entered into the interior capsule of the Titan and attacked all 5 people inside, and then all the zombie spirits carried the Titan deep down inside a cave hidden underneath the ship's bottom hull section, never to be found by search teams and forever entombed as part of the Titanic wreckage, with the Titan's 5 members joining the 1200 other zombie spirits for eternity and sending a warning and message to other potential explorers to leave the wreckage and its inhabitants alone, forever preserved as an underwater graveyard.

"Perhaps they can use a AI neural network and genetic algorithm to help triangulate the banging sound source from multiple sonar / GPS linked buoys.  If they create a 3D cubic grid of buoys placed at the closest previously deployed buoy location,  that has had the strongest ping signal so far,  and all ping at 5 second time intervals and each buoy had say for example 200 metres separation both horizontally and vertically, perhaps they could get a quick multilateral triangulation on the tapping sounds.  Each buoy would need a GPS self correction algorithm to account for drift or have a small repositioning motor to help keep them all aligned in a 3D grid. Thus the buoys would be positioned in an X,Y,Z axis 3D grid placement arrangement.  Each ping would factor in ping time / distance component between buoys by using a computer algorithm.  This grid might be able to identify the exact position of any object emitting detectible sound, based on the time it takes for the return signal to be detected abd the strength and signatue type of that signal. For example a return signal from deeper water might be different to a signature from a sound at the same level as the detecting buoy, etc...  Idea needs work, but it might be possible.  Would be a complex algorithm, but possible. Would need to factor in reduced ping signal strength over distance and time etc.... relative to each buoy's X,Y,Z co-ordinates.  The returned ( time and strength ) signal data might allow one to construct a multilateral triangulation target zone of the approximate X,Y,Z co-ordinates of the object that is emitting the tapping / sounds.

"I just watched a short interview with an expert in the field from Cambridge, MA. He says the only realistic recovery possible would be to sink another submersible down to attach a line to the vessel. This line would essentially pull up the trapped sub. The line/cable is attached to a shock absorber on a ship on the surface to ensure it doesn't snap. The cable has a maximum length of 20,000 feet, which is more than sufficient in length. However, firstly the sunken vessel needs to be located. Even if it is located, logistically, getting the correct equipment on scene is unlikely within the given time frame due to complexity of such a rescue mission. This mission would also put the rescue team in grave danger of suffering the same fate.",8,240.0

They bolt the opening shut with 14 bolts so even on the surface they can‚Äôt self rescue. Sounds like they didn‚Äôt want to pay to engineer a hatch. I guess also the seas have gotten rough out there and there‚Äôs a lot of whitecaps on the water, so looking for a white small submarine amongst big waves and white caps is pretty hard.

"Perhaps they can use a AI neural network and genetic algorithm to help triangulate the banging sound source from multiple sonar / GPS linked buoys.  If they create a 3D cubic grid of buoys placed at the closest previously deployed buoy location,  that has had the strongest ping signal so far,  and all ping at 5 second time intervals and each buoy had say for example 200 metres separation both horizontally and vertically, perhaps they could get a quick multilateral triangulation of the tapping sounds.  Each buoy would need a GPS self correction algorithm to account for drift or have a small repositioning motor to help keep them all aligned in a 3D grid. Thus the buoys would be positioned in an X,Y,Z axis 3D grid placement arrangement.  Each ping would factor in ping time / distance component between buoys by using a computer algorithm.  This grid might be able to identify the exact position of any object emitting detectible sound, based on the time it takes for the return signal to be detected abd the strength and signatue type of that signal. For example a return signal from deeper water might be different to a signature from a sound at the same level as the detecting buoy, etc...  Idea needs work, but it might be possible.  Would be a complex algorithm, but possible. Would need to factor in reduced ping signal strength over distance and time etc.... relative to each buoy's X,Y,Z co-ordinates.  The returned ( time and strength ) signal data might allow one to construct a multilateral triangulation target zone of the approximate X,Y,Z co-ordinates of the object that is emitting the tapping / sounds.

The lawyer said, that he would ask the Judge, if we could speak privately, when my case was called. Meanwhile. Before, I get called to the bench, there are people around me, who owe like 8K in credit cards, who refuse to pay 15 dollars a month. There were people, who were in for violent crime, talking about how they hated the judge. I eventually get called up, and it's all done quietly. And the judge looked at me, and I looked back at him. He was really serious about making certain I understood they were treating me different. I said 'Thank you, your Honor,' and I walked out of there, with this renewed faith in the legal system.

It is completely unreason. Remembering that when abusing took place  , people who helped  the church  would know it  easily  . Even a girl only likes a father with her attitude , gestures.. then  people  who helped   the church noticed it and Christans in  the church  always observed and follow her also the father  from their each  gesture , each action to prevent immediately . A father had  bad behaviour( that they blamed  him abused someone)  is most of those things,  he  was seduced  by girls   or women .

"UPDATE: Based on the optimistic news that ""sonar; on both buoys and a Canadian submarine hunter aircraft, are hearing banging sounds about every 30 minutes in the search area of the DSS [Deep Sea Submersible] "" (presumably made by 1; or all, of the 5 passengers including the CEO of the ""RMS Titanic tourism"" company that owns the lost DSS), and also of a previous ""DSS-to-Tatanic accident"" that someone reminded me of in a Comment to my post, I am adding another possibility (but of lesser probability because of the time line) of what has probably occurred, as the DSS seems to NOT HAVE suffered a ""catastrophic hull failure"" which would cause an instant; and deadly, implosion of it, so it is probably still intact. Here is my analysis: (1) Based on the fact that communication was lost BEFORE enough time had elapsed for the submersible to have reached RMS Titanic at it's resting place 12,500 ft. BSL; with my rudimentary calculations that the DSS  was at approximately 9,500 ft. BSL (or roughly 45 minutes away before reaching RMS Titanic), it is probably snagged on either a ""remnant"" (partial/torn net) or a complete ""trawl ghost net"". Trawl nets are very large nets 40 to 60 feet wide and 8 to 10 feet tall and up to 2 miles (10,560 ft.) long, and made from a very strong nylon and polypropylene compound, that are dragged behind a fishing trawler, and used to gather thousands of fish at a time. A ""trawl ghost net"" describes either a lost, forgotton or abandoned trawl net - that includes a remnant or complete net. (2) Of lesser probability is that 2 ""failures"" occurred onboard = Communication was lost rendering the DSS (in the pitch black of these depths, navigation to the RMS Titanic is made via sonar imaging triangulation from a support vessel on the surface) ""foundering underwater"" and the battery array that was providing the electrical power (for propulsion thrust, etc.) somehow failed at the same time = they are still ""foundering at sea"" either underwater or on the surface.",14,288.0

The company cut corners and screwed the customer out of their money. If I'm paying a quarter million dollars to go down there I want a ship at the surface floating over me monitoring everything and ensuring my safety.

Sorry to say there will most likely be no rescue. The sub is designed to automatically surface via many methods if power is lost. They have searched the surface with sub hunter aircraft.

They need to call in the best sonar man from a regular sub that‚Äôs possible in the time they have. It‚Äôs a sad situation to pay all that money thinking this company has the best civilian sub and crew, not to mention technology, only to have it fail with no one able to find you or rescue you. Would be an extremely difficult way to go knowing there‚Äôs nothing that can be done. Frustrating beyond belief for the poor souls aboard that vessel.

They should also file an ocean navigation plan down to the very minute of travel time !!!  Don't they have triple redundant sonar and distress signal systems ???  Utterly ludicrous !!!    They need a 5 km fishing line tether that has a manual release that has a flotation device on it and in emergencies can be released and floats back up to the surface and sub surface with a sonar and GPS surface locator. Also for every 1km of decent they could release a solar powered GPS buoy up to the surface to provide approximations on location and last known depth.,1,264.0

These are the type of individuals that make our world better and who we don't have to worry about whether they'll do great things because they already are.",24,264.0

"Remembrance for freeing the slaves is Memorial Day, when hundreds of thousands of citizens died in the Civil War for this cause. The slaves did not completely know what was happening, so they believed it was sometime between the 13th and 19th of June that they were freed, therefore ‚Äì Juneteenth. The iron chains of slavery were eventually replaced with the bureaucratic chains of welfare, destroying the nuclear family just as much as a slave auction.

"As a former US Navy submariner and I hope they had a minor incident and made an emergency surface. If they were not able to surface it is likely they had a major incident, flooded and sank. If so, they all perished before hitting the bottom. If and when they find the craft, they will have to make a decision as to recover it (if that is even possible) or leave it as a marine grave.",61,288.0
"The luck of any ""rescue"" (body recovery) mission will depend on what the condition of the vehicle is; if it was some kind of power failure, finding the crew alive is remotely possible. But I wouldn't bet on it.  
Unfortunately, the most likely scenario is a catastrophic failure of the submersible's hull while it was en route to the bottom. It sounds like this specific submersible had many years of dive and recovery cycles, as well as maintenance issues that were growing in frequency and severity - if the metal of the hull developed even the tiniest microscopic fissure because it's fatigued or brittle, the result at crush depths is an implosion. If that's the case they would have been crushed instantly by 6,000 PSI of ocean volume - the human body is used to a constant pressure of about 15 PSI - obviously, instantly being subjected to 6,000 PSI is going to be a pretty traumatic shift. They wouldn't have known what hit them.",133,288.0
"I feel bad for the people on board, yet I totally disagree with some of these guys on tv who seem outraged that more isn‚Äôt being done to help. Going down to Titanic is dangerous. They‚Äôve previously had issues with losing contact with these submersibles. Now it‚Äôs like, hey everyone needs to drop everything and spend millions of dollars and risk more lives to help them?This isn‚Äôt a plane that went down. This isn‚Äôt a ship that sank. These are wealthy people who chose to spend their money doing something extremely dangerous. To come off as expecting everyone to drop everything and hurry up out there to save them is just ridiculous. What happens next time? And the time after that? And the time after that? They knew the risks. What do people expect to see down there? It‚Äôs very dark and again, extremely dangerous. They can see much more just by looking on the internet.

These wrecks can drift a ways like a plane crash under power and descend off course. It may have lost power. Thermals can affect comms signals. Hopefully they can send robots to tow it up or latch on and surface with them in tow. There is no diving option at that depth as to scuba and a swim. The crush depth of a larger displacement submarine is shallower than this vessel likely, They can help find them perhaps? Secret group in the silent service.

In this case suppose the tank is ""junk"", nothing more than a wind up toy, they were able to use it to clear what could be a massive swath of a minefield quickly without a sweeper and take a position. Once the tan clears the area, the soldiers flood the zone. Another way it could be used would be to just make lines of them and send them at a fortification, what would stop them?

Now there is an argument to be made about whether an investigation should have been sued or not but they didn‚Äôt come out and say this happened. These are the charges we are bringing they came out and said we are looking into this. It would be different if they didn‚Äôt have reason to look into this, but you literally have the political candidate himself saying Russia do this Russia do that he didn‚Äôt say it over the phone. He said it at a rally. It would be different if you didn‚Äôt have people on his campaign going overseas and reaching out to Russian agents but that‚Äôs what happened. Now these people may or may not have known that these individuals were Russian agents, but you had Russian agents in contact with a political campaign. When you see this, it Hass to be investigated. Was there a rush to judgment by the investigators perhaps but they didn‚Äôt pursue charges either. In fact what you should know is when they got through with that investigation, you know the FBI investigation they said if this man wasn‚Äôt President of the United States, we would bring charges against him, but since this is the President of the United States, we won‚Äôt we can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the conclusion they came to people would‚Äôve been charged with federal crimes had Donald Trump not been elected president. However, even if they weren‚Äôt, you need to consider the fact that somehow people who were pro, Russia ended up in contact with American political campaign representatives. That‚Äôs the part that should scare you people from a foreign adversarial nation or talking to leader ship in a political campaign.

However, he's very concerned by the Durham report, even though it was the product of a hack AG and his hack special prosecutor, who announced before it started that they would uncover bombshell conspiracies, who flew to Europe to press allied intelligence agencies for info against Biden and then ignored and shelved direct info that these allied intelligence agencies instead provided against Trump, and yet after 4 years of unrestricted investigations with no budget limit that was allowed to continue unfettered and unmonitored by the incoming Biden administration, could not come up with any indictments, let alone convictions (except for two obviously political indictments that were laughed out of court by juries after almost no deliberations), and a totally hack report that was directly contradicted by a bipartisan Senate committee and by a Republican Inspector General.",1,312.0

As a all my life ""Christian"" with strong values of virtue a long hard life standing up against abuses done to me just as a regular white straight God fearing woman and mom by supposed righteous white Bible following Christians the number 1 thing I've held strong on is that abuse in any form is NOT approved of by God. Especially is expected more so by the the churches representing Christ because to call anyone of God's children under the sun NOT good enough to be welcome into ANY place of worship is NOT just abuse to God's children but abuse to the name of Jesus and Christian for if Christ died to save only the righteous then might I remind them, ""let him who is without sin cast the first stone"" that father did what Jesus said by laying down his life seat in that senate church for his son, and that in my personal opinion shows more love of God in truth than any reformed Christian church because God IS love and love IS God and we are Called to love and NOT play Gods.

"Yes AI is going out of control. Many may be asking how and why? Simply put we found that using GPUs could be much more powerful than CPU and since that finding the boom started as we removed the speed limitation of the CPU itself. With that, is AI bad? No. But sad to say as it will change our lives with wars starting over it. 2023 will be remembered. Keep in mind that AI is old news as they are now working on AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). OpenAI is getting really close with debates if GPT4 as sparks of it. They had planned for AGI in GPT7. (GPT5 was to give it sight; 6 to give it hearing; 7 to give it AGI) But it seems that GPT4 may have AGI as they changed their home page to read: ""Creating safe AGI that benefits all of humanity"" For many who still may be at a loss at what AI is, here is another way to look at it: Albert Einstein IQ was 160; latest version of AI 155. AGI is just around the corner that could have an IQ of 1600. And remember these are just the early versions.",1,312.0

In a few weeks his military was exposed as a Potemkin Army hollowed out by corruption and inaptitude.

"From my point of view, the reason Putin is moving tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus has nothing to do with Ukraine or the West, that's just a cover story. 
The real reason is Lukaschenkos physical condition. It seems he could die in the short future. Which could lead to a regime change, as from what we heared, the army refused to go into war when Putin was demanding Belarus to do so (which also explains why the Russians have not been prepared for the war from the north nor had enough troops for this attack). So Putin can't be sure after Lukaschenkos death Belarus would still stand on his side. Neither the Belarussian people nor army is doing so already today. The moment he has nuclear weapons in Belarus, he can send troops any time pretending he will only protect the weapons. Does it sound familiar to hear such cover stories of only protecting? Krimea? Donbas? Moldova? ",91,336.0

Does anyone else see what is being set up here? Lukashenko is going to be the fall guy and get blamed for 'accidentally' sending a tactical nuke, say, into Crimea should the Ukrainian offensive take back the peninsula as retired General Ben Hodges says they will do by August of this year. Then when that happens, guess who falls out of a third story bathroom window? Russia can claim innocence because a loose cannon lost his marbles and fired off a mushroom cloud maker.

The state of Russian weapons in general were exposed to the west when archival tanks and artillery were pulled out of mothballs for the Ukraine war.

Living a life in fear, in hatred, or in the thrall of one's own spur-of-the-moment desires is no way to live a life. It's not a mature way to live one's life, it's a childish way.

Dominated and gave us some unforgettable characters and movies. Met and married the beautiful Maria. Got into politics and once again Dominated.

We in this country often think in terms of our ‚Äòrights‚Äô which is kinda the same argument over what exercising our free will should look like and what are the boundaries that we can all agree on.
I have shifted my personal view and now try to think in terms of my responsibilities as opposed to my rights. If I‚Äôm alone on the island then I can do whatever I choose.

What makes them think we don't? If anything there are people in the US who would like to do business with China so that we can all prosper.

"The situation in Ukraine is truly unbelievable. It's astonishing to see how our world can still have such backwardness. Undoubtedly, Ukrainians are one of the world's most decent and resilient populations, enduring immense suffering. The tragic consequence of this horrific massacre, perpetrated by a deranged and genocidal maniac, is the loss of a significant portion of their population. Although recognized as an organization, the International Criminal Court (ICC) often lacks the power to effectively address such atrocities, making it appear ineffective. Meanwhile, NATO, the UN, and the EU hold countless meetings, comfortably seated and financially secure. In stark contrast, Ukrainians sacrifice their lives in service to these organizations every second, every minute, and every hour, merely hoping to sustain their livelihoods. It is evident from Putin's well-documented history of causing bloodshed that he should have been stopped from the outset. Unfortunately, this is the reality of our world today‚Äîwhen physical harm doesn't directly affect us, we passively observe events on our screens, eagerly awaiting an outcome. We hold onto the hope that Ukraine will emerge victorious, but if fate takes a different turn, we can only lament that we did what we could amidst this unfortunate situation.

"I think it has something to do with social status also. I had a miscarriage 35 years ago while in my late teens.  I had no health insurance so I could only take urine tests that kept coming back negative.   My thyroid meds were masking the hCG.  I had a thyroid storm which are rare because people have insurance and get treated before it can become deadly. I was a petite, relatively attractive, intelligent young woman going to school to make something of herself that didn't have the money to take care of her health. I nearly bled to death on the care ride to the hospital.  My mother took me so I didn't have and ambulance bill on top of what I had just been through. Blood all over the bathroom walls and floor.  I still remember the sound of clots hitting the tile.  I was taken good care of in the ED, but it should never have to come to that for anyone, anywhere, ever. I had a painful glimpse in to all of that. It's scary and lonely.  Who has the time to advocate for themselves when you're just trying to keep your head above water.

"The only way to fix this and other medical problems is to take the profit motive out of medicine.  All Hospitals, medical insurance providers, and pharmaceutical companies must become non-profit companies, and top tier executives pay needs to be at a set, reasonable, ratio.

The largest muscle in the human body is the Uterine muscle.  It's hard to train this muscle for proper use during pregnancy and delivery.  This is another example that women don't know how to beef up that muscle and doctors also don't know how to help women do anything but Kegel exercises.  Pregnancy and delivery are athletic events much different from running or lifting weights and it is a lifelong need to not worship men with steroidal muscle mass but help women to participate in all forms of training for uterine muscles and the work they do in labor and delivery.  And that muscle's work if generally involuntary.  The medical profession and women's sports training for the average woman must address this crying need for women to have a strong and healthy uterine muscle.  Delivery requires the best of uterine muscle conditioning.,5,336.0

Christie is the ONLY Republican I can vote for in a PRIMARY !!,197,336.0
"True story. In the summer of 2016, when the GOP convention came here to Cleveland, Chris Christie visited a ""Yours Truly"" restaurant in Shaker Heights, local to us. We managed to be eating dessert just as he and his small entourage came in and took an adjoining table. We didn't want to sound like we were eavesdropping, but it was clear to us, just listening to the snippets of dialogue, Chris hated Trump's guts. He talked about his strategy in case Trump got the nomination, as everyone assumed he would. He said one sentence that chilled us to the bone, ""I dunno what's gonna happen to the country the minute he's in power."" But mostly he was upset that Trump had snubbed him to go eat lunch with Paul Manafort and a couple of other people Chris didn't know. All he knew was they didn't speak very good English and Trump treated them like kings.",1,336.0
"Honestly, I think this guy could be Biden's biggest threat. He sounds sane-ish compared with DeathSantis or Lying Trump, and many independents might be drawn to him...",57,336.0

"If he's the nominee, I will cross party lines to vote for him. For the first time since 1988!",6,336.0
So true. He's telling the truth. Finally.,80,336.0

"A republican candidate making sense and speaking calmly , makes a change !",1,336.0
"I watched  this. Didn't mean to but it was on. I am a democrat and i thought Christie made a lot of good points. That's all people want is to be able to work out our differences in compromise. I don't hate anyone on the right, I hate that they abandoned science, reality, facts, compromise, justice and decency. If the right wing can ever let go of that traitor chump, we could actually get things done by coming together. As a nation, we could really accomplish big things working together.",48,336.0

"As i do live in nj ill never forget during hurricane sandy, which was the worst thing that happened. I didnt hav3 power for a month and a half, but he earned my respect when he personally ask obama for help. He wasnt worried about his career, he was worried about us NJ folks qnd thats honor",7,336.0
Now what he's saying about the child analogy is just totally true. But I've been said Trump acts immature. Even though he's the second oldest president ever.,77,336.0
"Ah, Chris Christie, the guy who tells people what he THINKS they want to hear.  What he says depends on what news station he is on.",2,336.0
It's refreshing to see this from people in the GOP.,64,336.0
"I'm Canadian but I was impressed on his position on drug addicts. You place users in treatment programs, you don't lock them up in jail.",44,336.0
"Thank you, Chris Christie for having the balls to speak up. And we need more Townhall scenarios like this where Republicans are asking questions. Just every day normal people asking questions - more please!",8,336.0
"He's right, but he should have seen through the con much, much earlier.",1,336.0
Its a sad state of affairs when Chris Christie is the sane one in the room.,16,336.0
This is Christie at his best.  It‚Äôs how a Repub was elected governor of deep blue New Jersey.,1,336.0
"‚ÄúA child‚Äôs reaction‚Äù No Chris, that‚Äôs a pathological liar‚Äôs reaction",1,336.0
"Wish Christie would be the nomination. I know that everything these candidates speak in happen. But I feel in my gut this guy is the most honest and straightforward of all, besides Biden. Just gives me a good feeling. I live how he engages the audience and looks every person in the eye. Unlike Trump who just talks about himself.",27,336.0
Holy crap that was a refreshing change. He's actually a sane decent man. There's hope.,92,336.0
Chris is for real this time around.,62,336.0
Chris should be the.nominee. hes honest. Reliable and dependable,1,336.0

Christie is like a breath of fresh air as a Republican,3,336.0
I‚Äôm a guy from jersey who knows Christie. He is not liked by many but right now. He speaks facts and truth! Trump is a child! And he needs to be held accountable,49,336.0

I have never really listened to this guy before but I must say I am impressed. I see China as my biggest threat living in Asia. He is right on the money.,28,336.0
A GOP who tells the truth!,54,336.0
"I love what Christie said about all the ""other GOP candidates being so afraid of trump"" he said ""SAY HIS NAME"".!! That is a perfect line for Christies campaign and his ""challenge"" about trump, telling all the other GOP candidates who refuse to speak the truth about trump SAY HIS NAME!!",7,336.0
It would totally  destroy Trumps enormous ego if this man got the nomination..,1,336.0
You can't believe an habitual liar even if he was president.,94,336.0
"This is a politician who answers questions straight-up and to the point, no bluster and no bullshit.",1,312.0
"I have to say, fair play to Chris Christie. Showing some actual balls and telling the truth. He's flip flopped in the past but gotta give him credit here.",12,336.0
"He broke with Trump when it became politically expedient for him to do so. With that said, it's probably better to have someone in the Republican primary who criticizes Trump than no one in the primary criticizing Trump.",1,288.0
It‚Äôs imperative that he and his colleagues and all officials running KEEP THIS UP. Please keep spreading the truth as blatantly and directly as you are.,7,336.0
I‚Äôd vote for Chris‚Ä¶he makes some compelling points.,6,336.0
Not a fan of Chris Christie AT ALL but listening to him gives me a small bit of hope that the GOP will wake up before trump continues to BLOW the ENTIRE party up along with our DEMOCRACY!  I  Chris Christie continues to CHECK trump & the GOP!,1,312.0

Gotta love Chris Christie,14,336.0
"Tell it like it is 
Christie",1,216.0
"I went to hear him talk a few years ago. He hasn't changed his comments about Trump. Back then he would call Trump to talk to him about his constant political mistakes. I remember him saying you picking people who are defenseless. He used a story about him degrading some secretary ( not cabinet) he was relentless on her someone probably making $40,000. 
He said Trump doesn't go after anyone that can stand up to him.",4,336.0
More and more I like Chris Christie!,7,336.0
All the respect for Chris Christie right here. He is an attorney and knows the law. My vote this year goes to RFK Jr. Who we need right now.,1,336.0
"Wow, Chris. Very sound and reasonable responses. That was refreshing.  I am going to watch the full town hall.",15,336.0
Christie is talking sense. Wouldn't it be just amazing if many more folks did.,3,336.0
"Smart guy, he gives me hope that GOP is going to survive Trump.  We NEED BOTH parties, BOTH sides of the team.   Argument and conflict is necessary, but pointless if it's not towards something productive.",1,336.0
"Presidential material. Could actually help bring the country together again so we quibble like ""family"" but have each others backs when needed.",10,336.0
"I'm no fan of Christy, but I appreciate him breaking it down to those maga folks . But in the end they are still under Trump's spell .",16,336.0
A breath of fresh Republican air - go Chris !,6,336.0
Christie you have my respect,7,336.0
How refreshing is this!!!!,1,336.0
I have to say my opinion of Christie has changed after watching this.,6,336.0
"He‚Äôs smart especially what he said about the negotiations, Chinese people want us to use their things but they don‚Äôt like using stuffs from the United States.",17,336.0
Where has this Chris Chrisiti been hiding? He sounds like a regular guy. I LOVE it üá∫üá∏ ,8,336.0
I didn‚Äôt even know Christie is so reasonable! ,10,336.0
"If I were a Republican, I would have broke with him when he massively increased the deficit in 2017.  But the deficit doesn't matter when you're funneling more money into the pockets of your rich pals, only when you can use it to kill programs normal people need.",1,336.0
Honestly this man is 300 pounds. If he can‚Äôt even take care of himself how could he take care of this nation,1,336.0
Finally Christie gets his game on.  Really ? you could have stood up 4 years ago. But glad you are finally speaking truthfully again.,4,336.0
God bless you chris  you are telling the truth,4,336.0

"If I were American, this guy would get my vote. He's intelligent,  calm, objective and capable out reasoning his way through any situation that he encounters, rather than trying to bluster through like Trump- including the way he says he'd stop the Ukraine war in a day, but doesn't say anything more on how (Leading us all to suspect he'd pressure Ukraine into giving up land).",5,336.0

"I would have respect for what Chris Christie is saying is he said he absolutely will not vote for Donald Trump under any circumstances...  but that's not what he said last week,  he said he will absolutely vote for Donald Trump if he is the Republican candidate,   so in reality Chris Christie is just another standard Republican cowering at the feet of fascism.",3,336.0

As a political lefty I would almost certainly disagree with almost all of his economic policy at least on the domestic front and I am not so sure we would line up on any social issues but compared to the rest of the offerings the fractured and often extremist Republican party have offered up as alternatives to the absolutely fascist Trump Christie seems at least grounded in reality. I think his honesty about the 2020 election and his firm but fair stance regarding China and expressing that he wants a peaceful and prosperous relationship with China but not war is at least a somewhat non threatening attempt at a  balanced statement.,3,336.0

"The situation in Ukraine is truly unbelievable. It's astonishing to see how our world can still have such backwardness. Ukrainians, undoubtedly one of the world's most decent and resilient populations, are enduring immense suffering. The tragic consequence of this horrific massacre, perpetrated by a deranged and genocidal maniac, is the loss of a significant portion of their population. Although recognized as an organization, the International Criminal Court (ICC) often lacks the power to effectively address such atrocities, making it appear ineffective. Meanwhile, NATO, the UN, and the EU hold countless meetings, comfortably seated and financially secure. In stark contrast, Ukrainians sacrifice their lives in service to these organizations every second, every minute, and every hour, merely hoping to sustain their livelihoods. It is evident from Putin's well-documented history of causing bloodshed that he should have been stopped from the outset. Unfortunately, this is the reality of our world today‚Äîwhen physical harm doesn't directly affect us, we passively observe events on our screens, eagerly awaiting an outcome. We hold onto the hope that Ukraine will emerge victorious, but if fate takes a different turn, we can only lament that we did what we could amidst this unfortunate situation. Regrettably, this is the society we find ourselves in, full of cowardice, completely intimidated by a mentally disturbed murderer.",5,336.0

"It‚Äôs extremely sad the whole thing. Such a gifted human being not just a genius in math he also was a great writer and engineer who was fluent in  writing in code and understood phycology. Schizophrenia is a horrible disease. I think from a very early age Ted knew that something was wrong with him in the way that he found it almost impossible to bond with people. The illness is like being trapped in a cage, you want the same experiences that normal people have like making friends and being excepted by your classmates and society. Ted felt shy around people and didn‚Äôt tolerate fools very well. He craved for all the things that bring us joy in this life. Contrary to what people think about Ted he didn‚Äôt really want the life he choose, he‚Äôs illness pushed him into this isolation. He felt that he wasn‚Äôt understood by he‚Äôs parents. He felt betrayed by he‚Äôs brother. David didn‚Äôt betray him yet Teds illness made him think that way. He‚Äôs brother and parents never stopped loving him. Schizophrenia makes people do things and say things in letters and in their writings that they don‚Äôt mean they just trying to express themselves it comes out like hate. I can only imagine the pain of not being able to adjust to society because the illness prevents the person from being an active member. Ted did want all the things in life like forming a relationship with a girl, getting married and having kids and living in a beautiful suburban home. If Ted didn‚Äôt develop schizophrenia he would have rose to great heights and become extremely famous yet the illness took over and made him infamous. I was saddened by he‚Äôs death. I knew he was dying of cancer but I always thought he would see it through to the end. Something has tipped him over the edge. What an awful way to go. He is no longer tormented by demons.

I cited Kaczynski in my master's thesis and discussed the character of Antonia Shimerda Cuzak in Willa Cather's My Antonia in the context of his theory of power process. The alternative would have been to crib the idea and not credit the sources or find someone else who said much the same thing. Probably, one those notorious French postmodernist literary theorists would have had something. Come to think of it, I could have worked some things theologian Harvey Cox said into support for the same idea. ",1,504.0

"I am delivering a sermon to you  please read
Consistently Pray for forgiveness, guidance in a good (positive) direction, and for help against evil. Pray to be saved from hell  (whatever that may be). Pray for your friends and your family too, it only takes a minute or so/less at a time to pray. Do it and your life will slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It probably just depends on you and the kind of person you are/have been. Don't wait until its too late and you have to suffer the consequences of built up bad karma from immoral acts/unrepented sins. Maybe together we can help make the world a better place by changing ourselves for the better, and changing things around us for the better.",1,504.0

"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries.",8,504.0

I think we should not underestimate the capabilities of early hominids but at the same time we should not overestimate either.

That is a bit like anthropomorphising a capability demonstrated by clever members of species who share the planet with us.

"Douglas Clayton III & Henry Charles Albert David Mountbatten, and ""What it Means to be Royal.""  Doug and Harry met on military business after both were discharged, and now we have half-baby-siblings, and I'm trying to figure out if I was Patient-Zero; the worst in the world; or a test mouse.  Like people have imaginary relationships with royals, I never heard the story about how Doug beat his psychiatrist at chess, and then the doctor said a Connecticut girl was a wrecking ball, and Doug said if it's true he would marry me, because we were both heirs at the time when our grandparents had to accept a probate clause that we'd be married before they released the estate.  Everyone wants to be royal, and I can see why, but some say they are harassed; and it turned out to not be me after everything the black widow (see Nazi flag,) was claiming.  His behavior is so nice that, as I sat down Doug was smiling at THEIR suggestion of another baby, and I said, ""It's a boy?""  They wanted to test me if I would enter a girl with Downs Syndrome in my notebook today; and that's how we got back to what he had said, which is that he would be willing to have a Downs Syndrome boy.  So then why did we have the twins?  What happened is they had us together in our thoughts, and in order to get away from me, he could legally take a Downs Syndrome child, and now THEY said we can get help.  Like she made me a pariah at Yale College, no one will be interested in coming around.  At the age of a couple months, Thomas Clayton felt he wouldn't be rescued if it weren't for the military, and Kylie Clayton has a medical trauma/torture at the same age, and both of them really WANT their father.

"In actual fact,  a massive ground counter offensive seems unlikely this year and could probably court disaster.  More likely next year.  This year needs to be an airborne counter offensive and that's still at least 4 months away.  This will require fighter jets, drones and long range precision missiles.  As many as possible.  Their role will be to disable supply lines,  along with disabling concentrated enemy ground positions.  Lighter drones will be best suited to combat on the front lines around the trenches.  Once the enemy has no supply lines,  they will barely last more than a few weeks in Ukraine,  so it's clear that this needs to be a top priority. Ukraine has performed better defensively and should continue to seek long range weapons to help minimise ground troop losses,  as their population is outnumbered nearly 4 to 1 by Russia.  Typically defensive posture has a 3 to 1 advantage over offensive posture,  which helps level the playing field for Ukraine.  They have to be extremely smart about how they prosecute their defence.  It would be better to invest more of those resources into making longer range drones at this stage and upskilling ground forces to take even greater advantage of this technology platform.  Eventually yes more ground offensives will be required,  however that's not now.  The 200,000 drones they have a goal towards achieving by end of year should be a top priority.  This needs cross country involvement and support at every level,  along with support from EU allied nations.",14,672.0

"It seems like there are way too many classified documents floating around and possibly that is the reason that people are so lax in the handling of them. Perhaps it would be a good idea to narrow the definition of exactly what will qualify as classified material and when, if ever,  it can be declassified. Also, a stiff monetary fine might help to disincentivize the routine nonchalance of government officials when it comes to their use. Ordinary citizens are fined for mistakes in tax returns, traffic violations, permitting, etc., so why would this potentially much more serious oversight be exempt? And lastly, why are these documents not checked out of somewhere, and the holder not held responsible? It is clear that we can't just trust them with important documents.

For example, a company never wants to have to suddenly pay out a bunch of PTO to employees so they encourage them to take time off even when it means the work will twice as hard when they come back to pick up the slack and various other dynamics like that. So as she points out, its largely because we dont trust management anymore because so many of us get a smile and then a knife in the ribs.",1,720.0

At the same time though, because of how terrible businesses are being run now, I almost always have to use my PTO as a severance bank at the end of employment anyway cause companies fire you /lay you off without reason or notice. I would guess thats why most Americans dont use their vacation time .... fear of one of the terrible managers finally causing them to lose their job and needing to take it al as cash to avoid bankruptcy while looking for a new job.",1,720.0

"You are repeatedly leaving out the most important part of all of this. Since CNN began covering this issue, not ONCE has anyone mentioned the formation of the Community of Serb Municipalities that would give Serbs of Northern Kosovo the autonomy they seek. This was signed and agreed upon by all sides in the 2013 Brussels Agreement and reinforced earlier this year in March when both sides met in Ohrid. The formation of the Community of Serb Municipalities is a condition that the Kosovar agreed upon, but has failed to implement. Instituting their ethnic Albanian mayors, following a 3.4% voter turnout, is just the latest in a long series of provocations and Serbians in Northern Kosovo are fed up. To improve your coverage of this issue & provide the context that your viewers deserve, please do your due diligence and include these important facts.",21,720.0
"Basically the gist of this is that the serbians are boycotting because Kosovo hasn't implemented the terms of the Brussels agreement signed by both parties ten years ago that was mediated by the EU.

I would invite anyone interested in an informed opinion on Kosovo to just go and read about the KLA. The KLA was the instrument utilised to create Kosovo and its commanders became ministers and prime ministers of Kosovo. The reasons for the overwhelming Western support for Kosovo's creation are fairly obvious since Serbia is the only Russian backed stronghold in the Balkans and the entire Europe for that matter. I'm no oracle but I have a feeling that historians of the future will describe the creation of Kosovo as the absolutely worst blunder of Western policy ever.,10,720.0

"South Slavic tribes began to inhabit these areas in the 6th century, and Serbs settled permanently in these areas during the first half of the 7th century.[8][9] During the early Middle Ages, the conflicting interests of Serbia, Bulgaria and Byzantium intersected in this area, which in 1018 regained control of the entire area of Kosovo and Metohija. The main strongholds of Byzantine rule were the cities of Lipljan and Prizren. In these cities were the seats of the Orthodox dioceses of Lipjan and Prizren, which were subordinated to the Ohrid archbishopric.[10] In the second half of the 11th century, Kosovo and Metohija became the scene of Serbian-Byzantine conflicts, which continued throughout the 12th century. The first mentions of ethnic Arbanas in history come only from the 11th and 12th centuries, in the area outside Kosovo and Metohija, south of Shkodra.[11]",2,720.0

"The history of the Balkans should be understood in its entirety, not just a part of it, in order to make judgments. I would like to add that Kosovo has not been implementing the agreements signed with the intermediation of the EU and the US for 13 years. On that day, special forces of the Kosovo Police, in cooperation with KFOR, took over Serbian buildings in the part of Kosovo where Serbs live, in order to install new Albanian mayors who were boycotted by Serbs in the elections. Serbs peacefully boycotted the elections, but conflicts erupted during the day as mayors were forcibly installed. KFOR soldiers were injured because they were not positioned between Serbs and the Kosovo Police, but rather with the police, as seen in all the footage that has been shown. It was obviously planned to drag Serbia, or rather the Serbs, into conflict with NATO. Fortunately, there are intelligent people on this planet who have understood what this was all about, and Kosovo has already received two sanctions from the US: exclusion from a military exercise in 2023 and a ban on entry for diplomats into the US. Serbia, like any other country and individuals, has made mistakes in life, and anyone who makes mistakes should be sanctioned or punished. However, territorial secession is a bit too much for the sake of personal interests. Serbia only wants peace and the resolution of problems through diplomatic means and the respect of signed agreements, while Kosovo hides and ignores the signed agreements because it is supported by its allies. It seems that even those allies have realized that Kosovo is a disobedient child, hence the reprimands and sanctions from the allies.",2,720.0

"The Chinese plane is causing wake turbulence on the American plane. That is, when a plane flies, the air behind it is turbulent ‚Äî and called wake turbulence. If another plane gets close to this turbulent air, this causes vortices of air around its wing tips. In other words, the higher pressure, on the bottom of the wing, becomes inverted and pushes down on the wings. This is why the plane was shaking. What is a real possibility: if the plane were a little closer, this would have caused the American plane to flip. That is, the turbulence would have pressed the lower pressure air on the of the top wing to become greater and forced the plane down, which may cause the pilot to lose to control.",110,720.0

"Hey man. I live in the United States, and it's really sad, the overall state here is extremely distressing. Today, my younger sibling, who attends elementary school, got blasted in his face. Rest in Peace. My father, who has a chronic illness, lacks the financial resources and access to healthcare and as a result, has developed a dependence on fentanyl. Adding to the desperation, my poor dear loving mother is compelled to engage in prostitution daily just to provide a meal for our family. She is very talented and very hard working, you can find her on the front page of thousands of  sites. These circumstances have led us to be homeless, forcing us to live on the streets, completely exposed to the cold pavement. The fear of potential mass shootings has paralyzed me to the extent that I'm too terrified to step outside our cardboard box shelter, fearing it might be my last move. If there were indeed another life, I genuinely desire to be born in any other country, in the hopes of finding a more promising existence.",21,720.0

"As a cruise ship navigation officer I can assure you that ships are literally built to withstand storms. This guy is very dramatic. The reality is that there was no immediate danger, even though I'm sure it's scary for some people. We have sensors on the bridge that measure the twisting and bending forces on the hull. There is also no guarantee that the lifeboats won't stay afloat in those weather conditions, they are made for that. Also it's highly unlikely the crew were preparing boats:  otherwise he would have heard a crew alert, and the general muster alarm, on the public address system. Sometimes Captains are forced to make decisions to go through bad weather instead of around it, and this can me for many reasons, so without all the information, it's not right to just say these things. With regards to making a law about, that is ridiculous and runs the danger of limiting the decision making power of a Captain. However, I'm sorry you had to experience it.",2,720.0
